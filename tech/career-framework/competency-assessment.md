# Competency Assessment

The biggest part of preparation for a performance review is competency assessment. The process differs based on whether you do it for the first time or whether it's a follow-up self assessment. Second part of competency assessment is discussion with the manager and alignment on the competencies during the performance review itself. All of these processes are described below.

## First-time Self Assessment

We use Excel (OneDrive) sheet to track your competencies and progress. Every person should have their own private copy so you don't need to be worried that some more sensitive personal information or comments would leak out. Check the [competency overview](competencies.md) to learn more about details of the competencies, BTW we're basing it on the [Etsy competency model](https://etsy.github.io/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder/competencies.html). 

1. **Download** the [competencies template document](https://github.com/MewsSystems/org/blob/main/tech/career-framework/mews-competencies-template.xlsx?raw=true) and store it to your personal OneDrive.
1. **Fill** in your scores (either 0, 1 or 2) for all the skills (cells of the sheet) in each level (column) for each competency (sheet). Please follow the [score definitions](competencies.md#skills) in order to ensure, that we have consistent scoring within the department. After you're done, it may look something like the picture below. The first row automatically shows your progress on the level, do not fill it in. In case of the below sheet, the level is intermediate in the communication competency.
1. **Share** the document with your manager so that they can see your scores, comments, comment on their own etc.

## Follow-up Self Assessment

If you have already done the self-assessment, have the document from last time, and you think there was a change in one of your skills, highlight it with a different background color and **insert a comment** describing the proposal and specific demonstrations that prove the change. Do **not update the score directly**, as this is supposed to be a discussion with your manager on your progress.

## Manager Alignment

During [performance review](performance-reviews.md) with your manager, competencies are one part of the agenda, you will be talking about your skills and possibly changing some scores. Focus on the practices in the level you reached (e.g. intermediate based on the picture above), one level above (advanced) and also focus on the practices where your score changed from the last performance review. Two things might actually happen, depending on your nature:

- If you tend to underestimate yourself, you might actually find out that your manager disagrees and your level is higher than you thought.
- If you overestimated yourself in some practices, you'll probably get lower score based on the discussion, which means there are still areas where you can improve.

After you are both aligned, identify some opportunities for improvement. Focus mainly on the orange cells in the level you reached (so that you cover all the practices in your level fully, that's really important). And also pick a few practices from the level above that you'd like to work on. In the end, this is a longer-term process (measured in years), so do not get discouraged if you don't move as fast as you'd like to. One practice to improve per competency is more than enough. These selected skills are great opportunities for [personal goals](personal-goals.md). The outcome of your competency assessment should be table similar to the one below which identifies levels within your competencies based on your skills and your overall progress in your career track.

Usually, you have your primary career track, that's the one you're currently at. And you have an aspirational career track, that's the one where you would like to be at going forward. So you should focus on competencies that are important for both of those tracks ideally. If it's a single track, then it's even simpler.

As a last step, update the weights in the Summary sheet according to your current career track [competency weights](career-tracks/readme.md) and send a screenshot of the sheet to your manager. You can also play with the weights and try other career tracks - that can help you identify what could be your career progression based on your current competencies.
