# Grades

The last piece of the puzzle is grading within career tracks. Career progress is a continuous number between 0 and 5, however we need to establish a finite number of job titles, grades in company-wide career ladder etc. That is why each career track is subdivided into finite (usually 4) buckets. **Based on your career track and progress, you can look up your grade within the table below.** That will determine your job title, your minimum salary bound, next salary bound and also grade in company-wide career ladder. It contains the following columns:

- **Career Track** - Name of the [career track](career-tracks/readme.md).
- **Min P** - Minimum [progress](progress.md) in the [career track](career-tracks/readme.md) required for the grade. Closed lower bound.
- **Max P** - Maximum [progress](progress.md) in the [career track](career-tracks/readme.md) required for the grade. Open upper bound.
- **Grade** - Grade within the company-wide career ladder.
- **Job Title** - Job title corresponding to the grade and career track.
- **Min Salary** - Minimum normalized salary awarded to the grade and career track.
- **Next Salary** - Next minimum normalized salary, corresponding to max progress.

> Please note that currently, we are not publishing the salary columns, those have been redacted out. All the examples involving salaries in these guides are arbitrary and do not represent reality.

For example an engineer with progress P = 2.50 would have grade IC4, minimum normalized salary 80000 and next normalized salary 120000. Their job title would be e.g. "Senior Backend Engineer". Some job titles contain `{Discriminator}` which is a dynamic placeholder that can be replaced with various values, most common ones are "Backend", "Frontend" and "Mobile" in case of IC roles. For management roles, it can be name of family or division. More on how to interpret and work with the normalized salaries can be found in the [compensation](compensation.md) guide.
