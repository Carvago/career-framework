# Career Framework

Our career framework is built bottom-up, which means it starts with very specific low-level skills which you can acquire. Having those skills advances you in different [competencies](competencies.md) where you basically level-up when you acquire new skills. Those competencies and levels reached there determine your overall career [progress](progress.md) within your [career track](career-tracks/readme.md). The career track is quite specific already and together with the progress, it determines your [job grade](grades.md), job title, salary bounds, [compensation](compensation.md) and also responsibilities (job description).

In order to determine all of this and **ensure that everyone progresses forward**, we do [performance reviews](performance-reviews.md) every six months. During a performance review, your manager will hold a general career discussion with you, you will [assess your competencies](competency-assessment.md) with the manager and talk about (or establish if you don't have any) [personal goals](personal-goals.md). To make sure we dedicate enough attention continuously to your personal goals, there will be three [performance catchups](performance-catchups) where your manager will check up on your goals and help you in any way possible to **achieve the goals**.

## Calendar

There are several important events during the year that are focused on career and personal development. You'll be notified about them well in advance:

- **January** - [Performance Review 2/2](performance-reviews.md)
- **March** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **May** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **June** - [Performance Review 1/2](performance-reviews.md)
- **July** - [Performance Review 2/2](performance-reviews.md)
- **September** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **November** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **December** - [Performance Review 1/2](performance-reviews.md)

The performance reviews are being done in a top-down manner to keep the expectations and requirements as synchronized as possible among the org chart branches. Therefore we allocate two months for the performance reviews. Usually the management layers are done during the first month, individual contributor performance reviews the second month.

## Timeline

There are a lot of activities happening during each performance review cycle, the table below highlights the most important events during a typical review cycle:
