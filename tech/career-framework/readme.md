# Career Framework

Our career framework is built bottom-up, which means it starts with very specific low-level skills which you can acquire. Having those skills advances you in different [competencies](competencies.md) where you basically level-up when you acquire new skills. Those competencies and levels reached there determine your overall career [progress](progress.md) within your [career track](career-tracks/readme.md). The career track is quite specific already and together with the progress, it determines your [job grade](grades.md), job title, salary bounds, [compensation](compensation.md) and also responsibilities (job description).

In order to determine all of this and **ensure that everyone progresses forward**, we do [performance reviews](performance-reviews.md) every six months. During a performance review, your manager will hold a general career discussion with you, you will [assess your competencies](competency-assessment.md) with the manager and establish [personal goals](personal-goals.md) for the upcoming six months. To make sure you work on your personal goals, there will be three [performance catchups](performance-catchups) where your manager will check up on your goals and help you in any way possible to **achieve the goals**.

## Calendar

There are several important events during the year that are focused on career and personal development. You'll be notified about them well in advance:

- **January** - [Performance Review 2/2](performance-reviews.md)
- **March** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **May** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **June** - [Performance Review 1/2](performance-reviews.md)

- **September** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **November** - [Performance Catchup](performance-catchups.md)
- **December** - [Performance Review 1/2](performance-reviews.md)

We are aiming to run the performance review top-down to keep it in sync between the branches of the department tree structure. Therfore the Performance reviews will be happening in two consecutive months to aim for quality over quantity. In reality it means the CTO, Division Leads & Family Leads will conduct their performance reviews with their direct reports during December/June. Team Leads will conduct performance review with their direct reports during the January/July.
