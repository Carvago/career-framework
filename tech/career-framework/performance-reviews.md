# Performance Reviews

Every 6 months, we do performance reviews of all members of tech team. The point of this is to identify your areas of improvement, so that you and your manager can understand where to improve and even what particular practices you should be focusing on. And as a consecutive step, either discuss your progress on your personal development or set up new goals if you don't have any. Note that if you've done last performance reviewÂ less than 3 months ago or if you are with us for less than 3 months, you should skip the performance review.

## Agenda

Before the performance review, **allocate 2 hours** to prepare for it, to perform the self-assessment and to think about possible personal development goals for yourself. The performance review usually takes between 1 and 2 hours, so reserve time for that as well. Plus there are some follow-ups afterwards so in total, to be on the safe side, expect around 5 hours of time investment. Your manager will send you invite to the event, so plan your activities around that. The meeting itself consists of following phases:

1. **Introduction** - Look back at the previous 6 months, talk about what went well and what went wrong.
1. **[Competency Assessment](competency-assessment.md)** - Before the performance review, you should perform self-assessment and during the performance review, you'll align on your competencies and skills with your manager.
1. **[Personal Goals](personal-goals.md)** - Talk about the progress of your personal development and possible further opportunities for you with your manager. If you don't have any personal goals currently, this is a great time to put them in place.
1. **Open Discussion** - Talk about your happiness in the company, problems, struggles, suggestions. Also you can share feedback with your manager.

## Managers

- Before the performance reviews, make sure you participate in the performance review training/workshop. There you can raise your questions or concerns, share your knowledge, share experiences with difficult conversations and learn from each other.
- In order to ensure consistency, we're doing performance reviews in a top-down manner. Therefore make sure you **first complete your own performance review** before doing performance reviews of your direct reports.
- Make sure you **schedule more than 1 hour**, at least 90 minutes with your manager for performance reviews. As part of the process, go over the managerial 360 report and discuss all insights and talking points that come out of the 360.
- Whom to involve into performance review talks?
  - If you are planning to hold a difficult conversation with your direct report, feel free to include your manager in the talk.
  - If you as a manager seek more underlying feedback regarding technical skills, include the relevant technical leader.
  - If you inherited a new report recently, include the previous manager in the performance conversation.
  - Before the performance review, consider gathering feedback from relevant peers of your direct report, as they usually have valuable insights.

## Second Level Managers

When you receive the competency scores of a given employee, update the tech-wide payroll sheet with the scores and bump the reviewed column to performance review date. In addition, **review the payroll sheet**, identify whether the employees deserve a salary increase (review the last raise date, their minimum and index) and validate the increase with the 1st level manager. Make sure the salaries are fair, and nobody is under the minimum. Good practice is to also review the personal goals of independent contributors and provide adjustment feedback to the team leads, if necessary.
