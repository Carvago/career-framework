# Competencies

We're basing our competencies on [Etsy's¬†competency model](https://etsy.github.io/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder/competencies.html)¬†which is a set of engineering competencies and skills several other big companies collaborated on, e.g. including Spotify. What we like the most about the model is, that it is actually **very ambitious** and in order to get to the top level in some competencies, it really requires technical or other excellence and industry thought leadership. It is not a shame at all if your level would be beginner in most of the competencies, level advanced already represents rather senior people. Level expert or especially leading expert truly means an industry expert and there are not many of those. So we took Etsy's model and adjusted it to Mews needs, our culture and values.

It is supposed to be aspirational, so if you're not sure, put in lower score or level. The **goal is to get better**, the goal is not to check all the boxes. The competency model is designed primarily for engineers, but with a little bit of stretch and interpretation, it is usable for all divisions and roles within technical department. There are five following competencies.

## üöö Delivery

Planning, prioritization, predictability, continuous delivery, testing and monitoring.

- **Beginner**
- **Intermediate**
- **Advanced**
- **Expert**
- **Leading Expert**

## üìö Domain Expertise

Knowledge of your domain, tools, business, product.

- **Beginner**
- **Intermediate**
- **Advanced**
- **Expert**
- **Leading Expert**

## üí° Problem Solving

Analysis, creativity, breakdown of problems, architecture of solutions.

- **Beginner**
  - You're able to resolve issues in familiar code or systems easily, and you can debug and fix unfamiliar code with some effort and guidance.
  - You recognize when you don't yet have the experience or knowledge to solve a problem and reach out to other engineers for help or guidance. You try to solve the problem on your own, but identify early when you're stuck and call for help.
  - You prepare to work on new tasks by planning an approach ahead of time and confirming it's well thought out.
  - You approach each new task as an opportunity to learn and continually apply what you've learned to each new challenge. Once learnt, you are able to solve similar tasks independently, you don't get stuck on same problems multiple times.
- **Intermediate**
  - You utilize data, quick prototypes and proofs of concept to find creative solutions to difficult problems. You make data informed decisions.
  - You recognize your own mistakes, use them as a learning and teaching opportunity. You are able to systematically adjust your approach to minimize the risk of repeating the same type of mistake.
  - You utilize your domain expertise, new technologies, patterns, and the domain expertise of others to solve problems you encounter.
  - You are able to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones that you can then solve one by one.
  - You have strong debugging and problem solving skills, allowing you to solve urgent problems, e.g. dealing with a blocker on production.
- **Advanced**
  - You are able to come up with iterative solutions that would lead to continuous delivery of value (aka slicing).
  - Your are able to anticipate problems and design solutions in a way that they reduce failure scenarios. Your solutions are future-proof and resilient against mistakes by others. You are able to identify edge cases early on.
  - You are able to zoom out, utilize data, technical strategy, product strategy, company strategy and other relevant context to inform the decisions you make. Your solutions are built for the long term and in alignment with the overall direction.
  - You reflect on solutions you have created, measure their impact, retrospect on how they were delivered and use that information to ideate and optimize future work. 
  - You are able to facilitate problem solving situations, identify coupled issuses, decouple them and help the group to reach consensus.
  - You are able to identify recurring problems and find root causes. You are able to solve the problems in more systematical way, than just ad-hoc solutions.
- **Expert**
  - You are guided by your experience to identify and solve issues with ease even when they are not in your domain, e.g. in other department you're collaborating with.
  - Your solutions are consistently successful across multiple dimensions, including performance, scalability, robustness and maintainability.
  - You create architecture that does not rely on you personally, and is particularly robust against single points of failure, both in terms of systems and people.
  - Your architectural proposals are informed by industry literature and you are able to develop enough domain expertise in the problem space to understand technological tradeoffs at a sufficiently deep level.
  - You are able to look ahead 6-12 months to identify areas of greatest need for a particular large system or project, and turn this into a roadmap with actionable milestones.
- **Leading Expert**
  - You create architecture that gets near-unanimous acceptance and adoption from critical stakeholders.
  - You craft solutions that require little support or overhead and continue working for a long lifespan.
  - You identify barriers that are slowing down teams and initiatives at Mews and create practical solutions, technologies, processes or tools to increase efficiency.
  - You are a leader who provides actionable direction to teams in the face of complex problems involving multiple stakeholders.
  - You create and publish new technologies or practices that solve industry-wide problems.

## üí¨ Communication

Collaboration with others, documentation, relationships with others.

- **Beginner**
  - You are able to clearly communicate in English and articulate questions that others will understand.
  - You collaborate with team members in various roles (e.g. other engineers, PMs, designers) in regular manner.
  - You document the important learnings, practices and solutions in a way that helps others when they encounter similar issues.
  - You actively participate in internal meetings of your team and not just passively listen.
- **Intermediate**
  - Your written communication is concise and clear. You cope well with the async / remote environment.
  - You write documentation related to your work that is well-structured, clear and easy to follow.
  - You collaborate well with team members a mentee. You are able to help more junior colleagues, e.g. by being their buddy.
  - You are able to take in vague requirements and ask the right questions to ensure they are clarified.
  - You have a sense for when and how to appropriately and effectively offer feedback on work. You provide the feedback in a respectful and constructive manner directly to the person, e.g. in code reviews.
  - You seek out and receive constructive criticism well and do not express territorialism over your work.
  - You listen when others are speaking and make space for your colleagues to share their thoughts.
- **Advanced**
  - You make sure the right people have the right context, not only in case of narrow projects you are working on but also larger initiatives. E.g. by documenting those or communicating that on various knowledge sharing sessions.
  - You collaborate well with people outside of your team or outside of R&D. You are able to handle cross-team discussions and escalations.
  - You quickly extract core issues from discussions and meetings. Your presence makes meetings more productive.
  - You are able to give and receive constructive feedback on all aspects, not only work but also behavior, presence, communication of others. And you both give and receive feedback clearly and with empathy.
  - You explain technical concepts clearly and with patience, and adjust your communication based on the audience.
  - You offer help when asked, but you also know when to step back and let others work things out on their own. You ensure that everyone you're working with gets a chance to share their thoughts and that they're heard.
