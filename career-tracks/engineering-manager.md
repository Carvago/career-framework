## Job Titles

The last piece of the puzzle is progressing within career tracks. Career progress is a continuous number between 0 and 5, however we need to establish a finite number of job titles. That is why each career track is subdivided into usually 3 buckets. **Based on your progress, you can look up your job title and salary bounds within the table below.** Job titles contain `{Discriminator}` which is a dynamic placeholder that can be replaced with various values, most common one is a name of team, family or division.

- **Job Title** - Job title corresponding to the progress.
- **Min Progress** - Minimum [progress](../progress.md) required for the job title. Closed lower bound.
- **Max Progress** - Maximum [progress](../progress.md) required for the job title. Open upper bound.
- **Min Salary** - Minimum normalized salary awarded to the job title.
- **Next Salary** - Next minimum normalized salary, corresponding to max progress.

| Job Title                                   | Min Progress | Max Progress | Min Salary | Next Salary |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Engineering Manager, {Discriminator}        | 1.00         | 3.10         | 0          | 0           |
| Senior Engineering Manager, {Discriminator} | 3.10         | 4.20         | 0          | 0           |
