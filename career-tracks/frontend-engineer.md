## How to find your job title

1. Do a [assessment](../assessment.md) to get your [score](../score.md).
2. Find your job title and salary band in the table below based on your score.

## Job Titles

Your [score](../score.md) (which is a continuous number between 0 and 4) determines your job title and salary bounds within the table below. However, your score is only a precondition to that job title. Other aspects of the job are considered for a promotion to happen (360 feedback, performance, etc.).

- **Job Title** - Job title corresponding to the score.
- **Score** - Minimum and maximum [score](../score.md) required for the job title.
- **Salary** - Minimum and maximum salary awarded to the job title. More on this can be found in the [salary](../salary.md) guide.
