## Job Titles

The last piece of the puzzle is progressing within career tracks. Career progress is a continuous number between 0 and 5, however we need to establish a finite number of job titles. That is why each career track is subdivided into usually 3 buckets. **Based on your progress, you can look up your job title and salary bounds within the table below.**

- **Job Title** - Job title corresponding to the progress.
- **Min Progress** - Minimum [progress](../progress.md) required for the job title. Closed lower bound.
- **Max Progress** - Maximum [progress](../progress.md) required for the job title. Open upper bound.
- **Min Salary** - Minimum normalized salary awarded to the job title.
- **Next Salary** - Next minimum normalized salary, corresponding to max progress.

| Job Title                  | Min Progress | Max Progress | Min Salary | Next Salary |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Engineering Manager        | 0.00         | 2.60         | 0          | 0           |
| Engineering Manager        | 2.60         | 3.80         | 0          | 0           |
| Senior Engineering Manager | 3.80         | 5.00         | 0          | 0           |

## Compensation

Your salary is based on your job title and salary bounds. More on how to interpret and work with the normalized salaries can be found in the [compensation](../compensation.md) guide.
