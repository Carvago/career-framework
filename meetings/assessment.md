# Competency Assessment

The biggest part of preparation for a performance review is competency assessment, make sure you reserve at least 2 hours for that. Results of the competency self assessment are used on [performance review meeting](performance-review.md) as input to discussion with your manager. Make sure to ask your colleagues for feedback in advance before doing the competency assessment.

## First-time Self Assessment

We use Excel sheet to track your competencies and progress. Every person should have their own private copy so you don't need to be worried that some more sensitive personal information or comments would leak out. Check the [competency overview](../score.md#competencies) to learn more about details of the competencies.

1. **Download** the [assessment template document](https://github.com/Carvago/career-framework/blob/main/assessment-template.xlsx) and store it to your Google Drive.
1. **Assess** your skills (Nope, Somewhat or Yes) for every competency (sheet) and every level (column). Level achievement is calculated automatically, do not fill it in.
1. **Share** the document with your manager so that they can see your scores, comments, comment on their own etc.

## Follow-up Self Assessment

If you have already done the first-time self-assessment some time in the past, you have the document from last time, and you think there was a change in one of your skills, highlight it with a different background color and **insert a comment** describing the proposal and specific demonstrations that prove the change. Do **not update the score directly**, as this is supposed to be a discussion with your manager on your progress.

## Grace Period

While our career framework works very well for more seasoned employees, recent hires might still need more time and opportunities to demonstrate all expected competencies during the first few months.

For example, if a recent hire goes through the first performance review four months after joining the company, many competencies typically expected from the role might still be unticked. And therefore, the overall progress would also be lower than expected. That is normal, and we grant each new hire a **grace period to demonstrate progress towards desired competencies**. The grace period might take up to **ten months**. The upper limit applies especially for more senior roles where we expect a demonstration of various expert competencies that might require particular conditions or to drive a long-term initiative successfully.
