# Retrospective

After each performance review cycle, there should be a retrospective session for managers, where they could discuss, share and learn from each other:

- What worked for them during reviews?
- What surprised them?
- Difficult conversations they had with their reports and how they handled it.
- Propose changes to the performance review process.
