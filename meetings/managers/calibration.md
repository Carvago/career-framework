# Calibration

Having people aligned on expectations from each role up front is the most efficient way how to ensure consistency. Therefore, we are going to have a calibration session with managers before each performance review. It helps us to catch possible inconsistencies early in the cycle before the final performance ratings are communicated to employees.

The process is the following:

- Employees fill in their self-assessment in the competency spreadsheet and submit it to their manager **ahead** of the performance review meeting. Employees are encouraged to ask their colleagues for feedback before submitting the self-review.
- Managers prepare a draft of the performance reviews for the employees based on their self-evaluation, feedback collected and performance observed over the last six months.
- Technical leaders prepare overview of responsibilities of their guild members and whether those correspond to the seniority. E.g. which senior guild members are not yet involved in code reviews as codeowners. Or, on contrary, which junior guild members already have more responsibilities.
- For all promotions to senior roles and higher (e.g. to Senior Engineer and higher for IC track), discuss justification/achievements.
- Review the list of people not progressing at all, people going significantly faster than others - discuss reasons.
- Managers might be asked/encouraged to change the proposed rating for an employee if their initial evaluation of the employee needed to be more consistent with other managers.
- Each role has specific responsibilities, and fulfilling them well is a prerequisite for good performance in a given position. And also, people can demonstrate additional competencies that are required for advancement in their careers. We need to recognize these two categories and not reward behaviors where people just go after the next-level competencies without doing their current role well.
- Competencies, once achieved, are not guaranteed to be retained forever.
- Calibration should also be an opportunity to discuss questions within a larger group to get more opinions.

Please note that we are still talking only about the proposed draft rating. While often this will accurately represent the fair employee assessment, there can be situations when some new important information comes up on the actual performance review meeting with the employee later, leading to rating adjustment in either direction. That is fine, but such occurrences should be relatively rare.
