# Performance Catchups

Since 12 months is a long time, the follow-up from the previous performance review can be easily forgotten. In order to ensure incremental progress on your goals, possible steering and adjustments, you should have a catchup each month on your 1on1s.

The **main goal is to check progress on you goals** and address any issues that arose. If you completed all your goals, it might be the time to setup new ones! ðŸŽ‰
