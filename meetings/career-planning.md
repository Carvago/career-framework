# Career Planning

When performing the [competency assessment](assessment.md), you will naturally identify some opportunities and get feedback during the review from your manager on your [performance review](meetings/performance-review.md). But how to make sure you progress until next time and improve on those? That's where personal goals step in. In order to prevent vague and unactionable goals, we use **SMART goals**. SMART is an acronym for 5 attributes that are desirable when setting the goal.

## Example

Let's say the goal is **`I want to become better at solving issues at production`**. We will showcase SMART attributes on this example.

- **Specific** - What should you aim to accomplish specifically?
  - Instead of: `I should get better at solving issues at production.`
  - Try: `I should gain skills necessary to tackle 80% of the issues on production on my own without required extensive help.`
- **Measurable** - How can you know you progressed?
  - Instead of: `I am better at solving issues at production.`
  - Try: `I am solving 25% issues of our team and need extensive help only in 5% of them.`
- **Achievable** - Can this goal actually be achieved? Try answering following questions:
  - Why is this a good goal for me? `I am already solving some issues and based on experience of others, this is a reasonable target.`
  - What could get in way? `Others won't let me investigate the issues.`
  - What resources would help? `Trainings on all observability tools like New Relic and somebody who will help you with tricky issues.`
- **Relevant** - How does it relate to your team, company strategy and our business goals?
  - Instead of: `I think it should help.`
  - Try: `We have low bus factor when it comes to solving production issues. Also it is a great way to get debugging skills, which are necessary during quality software development.`
- **Timebound** - When do you plan to achieve that?
  - Instead of: `Sometime in the future.`
  - Try: `By the next performance review.`

## Inspiration

The purpose of the goal is to help you improve. Therefore, avoid setting the company or process-related goals. There are several ways how to identify what could be your next goal:

- Not yet mastered skills from the competency sheet.
- Filling in a personal development plan or following a career guide, either company-wide one or some public.
- Talking to people around you (not just your manager).
- Your own imagination or ambitions, sky is the limit here.
- One of the following examples:
  - Improving **hard skills**:
    - Explore a new technology and provide a knowledge sharing session, e.g. based on [thoughtworks radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).
    - Participate at a conference or meetup, summarize and share the outcomes.
    - Get better at troubleshooting production issues.
    - Open-source participation.
  - Improving **soft skills**:
    - Priorities and time management.
    - Communication, giving feedback.
    - Technicl leadership.
    - Get better at gathering and sharing the knowledge.
    - Mentor others.
  - **Learn** some domain, being it business or technical one (e.g. learning how payments work or advanced concepts of functional programming).
  - Be **responsible** for delivery of some epic end-to-end (e.g. deliver some feature from solutioning to production, including the monitoring phase).
  - **Sharing knowledge**, contributing to public awareness (e.g. internal meetings, blogposts, meetups, panel talks, podcasts).
