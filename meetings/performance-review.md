# Performance Review Meeting

Every 12 months, we do performance reviews. The point of this is to identify your areas of improvement, so that you and your manager can understand where to improve. And as a consecutive step, either discuss your progress on your personal development or set up new goals.

Before the meeting, make sure you have the [assessment](assessment.md) completed, think about progress on your personal goals, think of possible new personal goals and also retrospect on your past successes and failures.

## Agenda

The performance review meeting usually takes 2 hours. Plus there are some follow-ups afterwards. To be on the safe side, expect around 3 hours of time investment. The meeting itself consists of following phases:

1. **Introduction** - Look back at the previous 12 months, talk about what went well and what went wrong.
1. **Skills Assessment** - Together with your manager align on your competencies and skills to get your score.
1. **Personal Goals** - Talk about the progress of your personal goals and possible opportunities for new goals with your manager. This is a great time to set up new goals.
1. **Open Discussion** - Talk about your happiness in the company, problems, struggles, suggestions. Also you can **share feedback** with your manager.

## Skills Assessment

The main topic of discussion will be your achieved skills and possibly some scores might change as outcome of the discussions. Focus on the practices in the level you reached, one level above (senior) and also focus on the practices where your score changed from the last performance review. Two things might actually happen, depending on your nature:

- If you tend to underestimate yourself, you might actually find out that your manager disagrees and your level is higher than you thought.
- If you overestimated yourself in some practices, you'll probably get lower score based on the discussion, which means there are still areas where you can improve.

After you are both aligned, identify some opportunities for improvement. Focus mainly on the orange cells in the level you reached (so that you cover all the practices in your level fully, that's really important). And also pick a few practices from the level above that you'd like to work on. In the end, this is a longer-term process (measured in years), so do not get discouraged if you don't move as fast as you'd like to. One practice to improve per competency is more than enough. These selected skills are great opportunities for [career planning](career-planning.md). The outcome of your competency assessment should be table similar to the one below which identifies levels within your competencies based on your skills and your overall progress in your career track.

Usually, you have your primary career track, that's the one you're currently at. And you have an aspirational career track, that's the one where you would like to be at going forward. So you should focus on competencies that are important for both of those tracks ideally. If it's a single track, then it's even simpler.

As a last step, update the weights in the Summary sheet according to your current career track [competency weights](../readme.md#career-tracks) and send a screenshot of the sheet to your manager. You can also play with the weights and try other career tracks - that can help you identify what could be your career progression based on your current competencies.
