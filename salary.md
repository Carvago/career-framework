# Salary

We define salary bounds based on your [career track](readme.md#career-tracks) and [score](readme.md#score). Your score determines your job title and therefore your salary bounds. The main purpose of the lower bounds is to ensure **fairness** across whole tech team and that nobody is underpaid. And as you get better, it also ensures that getting a raise is **guaranteed**. So at the moment, it's mainly an "alerting" mechanism for managers rather than a magic formula that determines the exact salary, especially because we acknowledge that the competencies do not capture full spectrum of stuff that everyone does.

## Normalization

The salary is expressed in a normalized form, which is a monthly salary. However, we offer different types of salaries (hourly rate, monthly). So in order to convert between hourly rate abd monthly salary use the following formulas:

- `Hourly Rate = monthly salary / 168`
- `MD Rate = monthly salary / 21`
- `Monthly Salary = hourly rate * 168`

## Examples

#### Monthly salary is 100 000 CZK monthly

- Hourly Rate = 100 000 / 168 = 595 CZK
- MD Rate = 100 000 / 21 = 4761 CZK

#### MD rate is 5000 CZK

- Monthly Salary = 5000 \* 21 = 105 000 CZK
